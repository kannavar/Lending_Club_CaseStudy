## General Information

Lending Club Case study is mainly about understanding of risk analytics area in banking and financial services. The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the given dataset and derive insights on the risk profile when lending to different types of customers.

**- What is the background of your project?**

Lending Club is a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 

There are two types of risks that are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is **likely to repay the loan**, then not approving the loan results in a **"loss of business"** to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is **likely to default**, then approving the loan may lead to a **"financial loss"** for the company


**- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?**

The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate. 

We will use EDA to understand how **consumer attributes** and **loan attributes** influence the tendency of default.

**- What is the dataset that is being used?**

loan.csv - This dataset contains information about past applicants and whether they "defaulted" or not.

Data_Dictionary.xlx  - This spreadsheet contains the description of all the variables (columns) present in the loan dataset.
